<div> You will find below a list of jupyter notebooks that I created to address different issues that data visualisation and machine learning
    can help tackle. I've tried my best to populate my work with comments and indications for reader to easily follow my thought process and understand
    the differents steps taken. If you are not too familiar with Python or code in general, please note that you can just focus on plain explanation and outputs.
